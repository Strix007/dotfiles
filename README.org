* Caution
This repo is tailored towards a 1920x1080 system so things may not look correct on other resolutions. This is something yourself to get working on your system. I might make things a bit more friendly on other resolutions in the future.

* Prerequisite Knowledge
You need to be a little familiar with the following to get the most out of this repo.
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3noK4GTmyMw][Xmonad]]
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TutfIwxSE_s&t=792s][Rofi]]
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPQ8m8xQAs8][Bash Scripting]]
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48JlgiBpw_I&t=1198s][Emacs]]

I have also linked good beginner resources if you need help with any of these.

* About
As I said above, this is meant to be my personal configuration that I can clone on my system and get working instantly so many things are tailored to my personal liking. There may be some things you might want to change to get working to your liking.

This config also took a lot of inspiration from [[https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi][adi1090x]]'s rofi and [[https://github.com/Axarva/dotfiles-2.0][Axarva]]'s xmonad configs so check them out.

** Wayland
  I needed to use some android apps on my system and couldn’t get anbox working so decided this would be a perfect time to configure a wayland wm for waydroid. I chose hyprland and waybar for this. It’s a bit rough around the edges and needs some more time but most things work. To get the wayland system up and running you need the following. Most but not all xmonad bindings work for hyprland.
*** Caution
The wayland setup has only been tested on arch linux. I don’t know if it will run just as smoothly on other distros. If you run into any issues, feel free to open an issue.

** Optionally
- [[https://i3wm.org/downloads/][i3]]
*Note:* Used to use i3 before xmonad, that’s why it’s here. Most things work with i3 but I mainly use it as a fallback wm.

- [[https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd][sxhkd]]
*Note:* Thought of moving all my non-wm related keybindings to sxhkd but found it to be buggy and decided not to do so. You can still use it if you wish as all my bindings are configured.

* Fonts
There are the fonts that are used in my configuratuin for text and icons. Make sure to install them.

* Additional Notes
These are additional notes and instruction you have to follow to get this config up and running.
** Xmonad
*** Xmonad With Polybar
Xmonad with polybar was a bit tricky to get running, I had to use [[https://github.com/xintron/xmonad-log][xmonad-log]] to get things working. I have already put a compiled binary of xmonad-log in =.config/polybar/scripts= so no worries there but you do need to install =haskell-dbus= manually through your system's package manager.

*** Xmonad Startup
Xmonad starts up a lot of things configured for my system, such as =rclone= etc. Make sure to disable the ones you don't need.

*** Xmonad-ctl
Xmonad-ctl is required for exit to login manager with rofi-powermenu. Make sure to use =-dynamic= flag when compiling =.xmonad/xmonadctl.hs=

** Emacs
*** LSP
Make sure to install the language-servers you need on your system.

*** Counsel-spotify
Define variables for spotify-client-id and spotify-client-secret for counsel-spotify in =.emacs.d/env.el=.

#+begin_example
(defconst spotify_class_id "yourclassidhere")
(defconst spotify_class_secret "yourclasssecrethere")
#+end_example

If you don't know how to get your spotify client id and secret, refer to [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spotidy/vignettes/Connecting-with-the-Spotify-API.html][this article]].

** Xmodmap
I have changed my caps key to ctrl and my right ctrl to caps key. If you don't want this behavior, delete =.Xmodmap=.

** Polybar
*** DIsplay
You need to set the MONITOR env to your output in .zshrc for polybar to display on the correct output.
*** Weather Module
You need to make a =.env= in your home directory with an [[https://openweathermap.org/][OpenWeather]] API key and the code of the city you want to get the weather of. For more details on how to do this, check out my repo [[https://github.com/strix007/polybar-getweather][here]].
